Arrays and Strings :
    * Merge Strings Alternately : a) run a loop of max len and append the char if its within the word len
                                  b) run a while loop while any one of the word is not appended fully with one pointer
    * Greatest Common Divisor of Strings : a) use gcd to get the possible substring divisor and check if its a divisor foreach string
                                           b) check if a divisor is possible by using s1+s2 == s2+s1 and then use gcd to get the substring
    * Kids With Greatest Candies : a) find the max of candies , loop through the arrayand add extra candies with each , if they are >= max
                                      then its true

    * Can Place Flowers : a) solve three cases - the 0 can be in start , end and middle , if its 1 then skip two indexes


TRICKS :
* To iterate through two data with dif length while comparing them , we can use while loop and iterate with OR condition of the lengths
    or just use one pointer to loop through both with OR
* To check if two strings are divisible with each other just check s1+s2 == s2 + s1
* if the edge cases over laps merge them
