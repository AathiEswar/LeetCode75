Arrays and Strings :
    * Merge Strings Alternately : a) run a loop of max len and append the char if its within the word len
                                  b) run a while loop while any one of the word is not appended fully with one pointer
    * Greatest Common Divisor of Strings : a) use gcd to get the possible substring divisor and check if its a divisor foreach string
                                           b) check if a divisor is possible by using s1+s2 == s2+s1 and then use gcd to get the substring
    * Kids With Greatest Candies : a) find the max of candies , loop through the arrayand add extra candies with each , if they are >= max
                                      then its true

    * Can Place Flowers : a) solve three cases - the 0 can be in start , end and middle , if its 1 then skip two indexes
    * Reverse String with Words : a) use regex to split the String and append from last
                                  b) use a pointer from last , iterate through till the word start is found and append the word by
                                   iterating to the word end and loop again from the last i
    * Product Of Array Except Self : a) try all possible values and product them and return them
                                     b) find the suffix product first , then prefix product in the same array and return that array
    * Increasing Triplet Subsequence : a) use three loops to find all possible combinations and satisfy the conditons
                                       b) Use two min vars , if num is less than min1 update min1 to num , same for min2 , if a num is
                                          greater than both min1 and min2 return true since we found the third greater num
    * String Compression  : a) Hookers algo - loop through the array , get the char and count = 0  , loop again till we found a char not
                               equal to chr , add the char to array with hooker index and add count if not 1 using hooker index

TWO POINTERS :
    * Move Zeros : a) Create a copy array , when the element is non-zero , add to copy array and move back copy array to res array
                   b) Use hooker algo , when encounter with a non-zero swap to hooker index and increment the hooker index
                   c) Use hooker algo , when encounter with a non-zero just change the zero to the num , in next loop change all num
                    to zero from the hooker index

TRICKS :
* To iterate through two data with dif length while comparing them , we can use while loop and iterate with OR condition of the lengths
    or just use one pointer to loop through both with OR
* To check if two strings are divisible with each other just check s1+s2 == s2 + s1
* if the edge cases over laps merge them
* StringBuilder , char Array can be changed to String by passing it to the string constructor
* Check iteration from both ends , for reverse just iterate from end
* For prefix and sufix , either do them in o(n^2) same loop or seperate in two loops
*
